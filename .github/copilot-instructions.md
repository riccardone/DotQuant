They removed invalid commands (`RecordLongGain`, `RecordShortGain`) and their related unit tests, as gains must result from real trading actions (e.g., reducing or covering positions). Command handlers were updated to raise gain events (`LongGainRecordedV1`, `ShortGainRecordedV1`) only as a consequence of valid position changes. `Apply(...)` methods were confirmed to be strictly for state mutation without raising new events or performing validation.",
